# Heliconius-melpomene-sensory-and-neural-transcriptomics
This repository contains the codes (and the parameters within them) to identify the neurotranscriptomic signatures associated with natural variation in mate preference learning in two subspecies of Heliconius melpomene. The example codes are for the brain tissues, but the same codes and parameters were used for the eyes and the antennae tissues.
